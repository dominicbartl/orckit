# CLAUDE.md — Orckit Architecture Guide

This file orients agents and contributors. Read [README.md](README.md) for the user-facing pitch and config reference.

## What this is

A lean CLI process orchestrator. It takes a YAML config, builds a dependency graph of processes, starts them in topological order (parallel within waves), watches health checks for readiness, forwards output, applies restart policies, and tears everything down on signal.

It is **not** a tmux integration, a dashboard UI, a build-tool plugin host, a daemon, or a resource monitor. Past iterations had all of those; they were dropped in the 0.2 rewrite. If you find yourself adding one, build it as a separate package that consumes the orchestrator via its event API.

Every file has one responsibility. There are no 3-file modules masquerading as one concept.

## Key design rules

1. **Schema is the source of truth for types.** Every config type comes from `z.infer<typeof someSchema>` in `src/config/schema.ts`. Do not declare a parallel `interface` for config shapes anywhere else.
2. **No runner inheritance.** There is one `Runner` class. Tool-specific behavior is a pure function in `process/parsers.ts` selected by `getParser(type)`. Adding a new build tool = adding one parser function + one case in `getParser`.
3. **Lifecycle is a pure state machine.** `transition(state, event)` in `orchestrator/lifecycle.ts` has zero side effects. The orchestrator threads side effects (event emission, runner control) around it. Test the machine in isolation; trust it everywhere else.
4. **Orchestrator emits events; reporter renders.** Don't `console.log` from `orchestrator/*` or `process/*`. The CLI reporter (or any consumer) listens and decides what to display. Tests assert against events, not stdout.
5. **No singletons, no module-level mutable state.** The debug logger reads env once at import; everything else is per-instance.
6. **Stop with grace.** `Runner.stop(graceMs)` sends SIGTERM via tree-kill, waits, escalates to SIGKILL. The orchestrator stops processes in reverse dependency order.
7. **Tests adjacent to source.** `tests/<area>/<file>.test.ts` mirrors `src/<area>/<file>.ts`. Unit tests for pure code; integration tests (in `tests/integration/`) spawn real bash processes through the full `Orckit` API.

## Process lifecycle in detail

```
                ┌──> ready ──> running ────────┐
pending ──> starting                            ├──> stopping ──> stopped
                └──> failed <──── exit/timeout ─┘                  ↑
                       │                                           │
                       └──> (restart policy)                       │
                       │                                           │
                       └──> starting ...                           │
                                                                   │
running ──(SIGTERM/SIGKILL via dispose)──────────────────────────> stopping
```

- `exit-code` ready checks: spawn → await exit → if 0, ready+running (process is gone but state stays "running" to satisfy downstream deps).
- Long-running with health probe: spawn → race(`waitForReady(probe)`, `runner.exit`) → ready+running; if exit wins, fail.
- Unexpected exit while `running`: fail → maybe restart per policy with `restart_delay_ms` and `max_retries`. The auto-restart delay is wrapped in an `AbortController` stored on the handle so a manual `restart()` can preempt it.
- Explicit `stop()`: pre_stop hook → SIGTERM → grace → SIGKILL → post_stop hook → emit stopped.

### Partial boot + manual retry

`Orckit.start()` uses `Promise.allSettled` per wave. It returns a `BootSummary` and emits `boot:complete: { ready, failed, pending }`. Processes whose deps failed stay `pending`. `all:ready` only fires when everything succeeded.

**Strict-by-default**: if any failed process did not opt in via `manual_retry: true`, `start()` emits `boot:complete` and then throws `BootFailedError` with the list of strict failures. The CLI catches it, prints a hint about `manual_retry`, and exits 1. Auto-restart policy still applies (a `restart: on-failure` process gets its retries before being declared failed); `manual_retry` only governs what happens once the retry budget is exhausted at boot time.

Mark a process `manual_retry: true` to let its boot failure be recoverable: `start()` does not throw, the REPL opens, the user types `r <name>` to retry.

`Orckit.restart(targets, { cascade = true })` stops then re-starts the listed processes and (by default) all their transitive dependents in dependency order. After the restart loop, `kickPending()` walks pending processes and starts any whose deps have become ready — that's how a successful manual retry unblocks the downstream chain that was waiting on it.

`kickPending` is suppressed while `inStartLoop` is true (during initial boot AND during `restart()`'s start loop), so the wave/loop driver doesn't race a fire-and-forget kick on the same process.

The interactive REPL in `src/cli.ts` (`reporter/repl.ts`) is the user-facing surface: typing `r backend` calls `restart(['backend'], { cascade: true })`. It attaches to stdin only when stdin is a TTY and `--no-repl` was not passed.

## MCP server: how Claude Code queries a running orckit

`src/mcp/` is a reporter-style consumer of Orckit: `attachMcpServer(orckit, opts)` follows the same shape as `attachLogReporter` — it subscribes to events (for last-error tracking), exposes a few synchronous queries from the Orckit instance, and returns a handle with `dispose()`. It runs **inside the `orc start` process** over Streamable HTTP on `127.0.0.1:7676` (configurable via the `mcp:` YAML block or `--mcp-port` / `--no-mcp`). There is no separate `orc mcp` subcommand and no IPC layer.

Three layers:
1. **`mcp/tools.ts`** — pure handlers that take an `OrckitView` (a structural subset of `Orckit`) and produce text + JSON. Trivial to unit-test against a stub.
2. **`mcp/server.ts`** — the HTTP server. In stateless Streamable HTTP mode the SDK requires a fresh `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` + `McpServer` per request (see the SDK's `simpleStatelessStreamableHttp` example); `attachMcpServer` does this in its request handler.
3. **`cli.ts start`** — resolves effective settings (CLI flag > YAML > schema default), calls `attachMcpServer`, prints the URL and a `claude mcp add` hint.

Anything that needs a richer view than `inspect(name)` / `states()` / `output(name, n)` should grow Orckit's public surface additively, not reach into private state.

## Web dashboard: how a browser drives a running orckit

`src/web/` is another reporter-style consumer of Orckit. `attachWebUi(orckit, opts)` returns a `{ url, port, dispose() }` handle just like `attachMcpServer`, runs in-process over HTTP on `127.0.0.1:7677` (configurable via `web:` YAML block or `--web-port` / `--no-web`), and serves three things from the same listener:

- **the SPA shell** (`packages/web-ui/dist/*`) — built artifacts copied into `dist/web/static/` at package-build time
- **`GET /api/state` + `GET /api/output/:name`** — initial-hydration snapshots over JSON
- **`GET /events`** — SSE stream of orckit events, beginning with a full snapshot for reconnect tolerance
- **`POST /api/restart/:name` + `POST /api/stop/:name`** — action endpoints calling `orckit.restart()` / `orckit.stop()` directly

The frontend lives in **`packages/web-ui/`** (a pnpm workspace, `@orckit/web-ui`, private, not published). It's SolidJS + Vite + Tailwind v4. Build it with `pnpm build:web` from the root; the static assets get copied into the cli package's tarball so end users get one `npm i @orckit/cli` without needing to run two build systems.

The `/sink` route is the design system kitchen sink — every component in every state with static fixtures. Keep it in sync when adding or modifying components in `packages/web-ui/src/components/`.

## Adding a new feature

- **New ready-check type**: add the Zod variant in `config/schema.ts`, add a class to `health/checks.ts`, add a case in `createProbe`. No other file should change.
- **New build-tool parser**: add a pure function to `process/parsers.ts` and a case in `getParser`. Add a Zod literal in `processTypeSchema`. Add tests in `tests/process/parsers.test.ts`.
- **New CLI command**: add to `src/cli.ts`. Use `loadConfig()` and build an `Orckit` instance; do not duplicate orchestration logic.
- **New event consumer (web UI, log file, OTEL)**: write it as a separate file that subscribes to `Orckit` events. Do not modify the orchestrator.

## Keeping public-facing docs in sync (REQUIRED)

[README.md](README.md), [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), and [examples/](examples) ship in the npm tarball and are the only thing consumers (humans + LLMs) see. They must reflect the current public API. **Any change that touches the public surface must update them in the same commit** — out-of-date docs are worse than missing docs because they get cached as ground truth.

What counts as "public surface":

| If you change… | …update |
|---|---|
| Any Zod field in `src/config/schema.ts` (add/rename/remove/default change) | README.md config reference, AGENTS.md decision trees + checklist, any affected example in `examples/` |
| Any export in `src/index.ts` (new/removed/renamed) | README.md programmatic API section, AGENTS.md programmatic API section |
| Any event emitted by `Orckit` (`src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`) | README.md events table |
| Any CLI command or flag (`src/cli.ts`) | README.md quick start, AGENTS.md workflow section |
| REPL commands (`src/reporter/repl.ts`) | README.md REPL section |
| MCP tool definitions or descriptions (`src/mcp/tools.ts`) | README.md MCP server section, AGENTS.md "Querying a running orckit" |
| Default values, error behavior, or anything that changes how a *working* config behaves | README.md, AGENTS.md anti-patterns / validation checklist if relevant |

Quick rules:
- AGENTS.md is for LLM agents writing configs / using the API — it's decision trees and pitfalls, not a field-by-field reference. Update it when the *advice* changes, not just when a field is added.
- README.md is the field-by-field reference. Update it any time the schema changes.
- Examples are ground truth for "what a working config looks like." If you add a feature worth showing, add or update an example. If you remove a feature, scrub it from existing examples.
- The `files` array in `package.json` controls what ships. If you add a new top-level doc file (e.g. `MIGRATION.md`), add it there or it won't reach consumers.

## What to avoid

- Putting display logic (chalk, formatting, console.log) anywhere outside `reporter/` and `cli.ts`.
- Adding "manager" or "service" classes that wrap a single function or hold a single instance — just export the function.
- Reintroducing inheritance into `Runner`. If a build tool needs special spawn behavior, model that as config, not a subclass.
- Resurrecting tmux integration, status dashboards, or build-tool library plugins inside this package. If you need them, build them as separate packages on top of the public event API.

## Common commands

```bash
pnpm dev                          # tsx watch on src/cli.ts
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test                         # all tests (~3s on a quiet machine)
pnpm test:unit                    # everything except tests/integration
pnpm test:integration             # spawns real bash processes
pnpm build                        # tsc → dist/, then build:web copies SPA assets
pnpm build:web                    # build just the @orckit/web-ui frontend
pnpm dev:web                      # vite dev server for the frontend
                                  # (proxies /api + /events to 127.0.0.1:7677)
ORCKIT_LOG_LEVEL=debug pnpm dev   # verbose internal logs
ORCKIT_DEBUG=Orckit,Runner pnpm dev   # per-namespace debug
```
